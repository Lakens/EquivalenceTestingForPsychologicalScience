The dataset was obtained from the supplementary materials provided by the authors on the OSF page accompanying the paper (https://osf.io/frq27/). The SPSS data file "Lab Study 1 Data for Sharing.sav" was converted to CSV format and subsequently cleaned: All cases that had been excluded from the final sample were removed (13 cases which were marked with the value 0 for either "BasicFollowedDirections" or "flagged"), resulting in a sample size of N = 100, as reported in the paper.
Additionally, all irrelevant variables were removed, leaving only "BasicFollowedDirections", "ExpCond" (experimental condition: -1 = unethical, 1 = ethical), "flagged", "ppnr" (participant number), "bright" (brightness of the room judged on a 7-point scale), "welllit" (well-lit-ness of the room judged on a 7-point scale), and "WellLitSca" (composite of "bright" and "welllit").

For the TOST, "ExpCond" is used as the independent variable and "WellLitSca" as the dependent variable: As Brandt et al. note in the preregistration document (https://osf.io/bewi7/), the authors of the original study (Banerjee, Chatterjee, & Sinha, 2012) had also used this composite scale:

"The primary dependent variable reported in BCS Study 1 is a measure of the brightness of the room. Although not specified in the published paper, we derived from the materials sent to us by BCS that this measure is composed of two-items. The first reads "How bright is the room" and ranges on a scale from 1 = not bright at all to 7 = very bright. The second reads "Please indicate how well lit the room is?" and ranges from 1 = not brightly lit to 7 = very brightly lit. These two items will be averaged together to form a measure of how well lit the room is and is the primary dependent variable for Study 1. Because it is not clear from the original publication how these items were analyzed, we will also analyze each item separately."
