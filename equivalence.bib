It provides sample size formulas and procedures for testing equality, noninferiority/superiority, and equivalence.    A comprehensive and unified presentation of statistical concepts and practical applications, this book highlights the interactions between clinicians and biostatisticians, includes a well-balanced summary of current and emerging clinical issues, and explores recently developed statistical methodologies for sample size calculation. Whenever possible, each chapter provides a brief history or background, regulatory requirements, statistical designs and methods for data analysis, real-world examples, future research developments, and related references.    One of the few books to systematically summarize clinical research procedures, this edition contains new chapters that focus on three key areas of this field. Incorporating the material of this book in your work will help ensure the validity and, ultimately, the success of your clinical studies.},

	abstract = {Bioequivalence between two treatments or two drugs is often assessed by comparing the two proportions (success rate or eradication rate) of binomial outcomes when the conventional pharmacokinetic parameters are inadequate for the assessment. Setting the equivalence limits can be based on one of the three measures: difference, ratio, or odds ratio between the two binomial probabilities. This paper reviews the existing asymptotic test statistics for comparing two independent binomial probabilities in terms of the three measures in the context of equivalence or noninferiority testing. The actual type I error and power of the asymptotic tests are evaluated by enumerating the exact probabilities in the rejection region. The results show that to establish an equivalence between two treatments with an equivalence limit of 20\% in difference, a sample size of at least 50 per treatment is needed. When the sample size is sufficient, the actual type I error rate is close to the nominal level (slightly above the nominal level in several cases) for a test in terms of difference for equivalence limits, and it tends to exceed the nominal level for tests in terms of ratio or odds ratio.},

A widely recommended approach within a frequentist framework is to test for equivalence. In equivalence tests, such as the two one-sided tests ({TOST}) procedure discussed in this article, an upper and lower equivalence bound is specified based on the smallest effect size of interest. The {TOST} procedure can be used to statistically reject the presence of effects large enough to be considered worthwhile. This practical primer with accompanying spreadsheet and R package enables psychologists to easily perform equivalence tests (and power analyses) by setting equivalence bounds based on standardized effect sizes and provides recommendations to prespecify equivalence bounds. Extending your statistical tool kit with equivalence tests is an easy way to improve your statistical and theoretical inferences.},

	doi = {10.1017/S0033291715001270},
	abstract = {Background
The Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd edition ({BDI}-{II}) is widely used in research on depression. However, the minimal clinically important difference ({MCID}) is unknown. {MCID} can be estimated in several ways. Here we take a patient-centred approach, anchoring the change on the {BDI}-{II} to the patient's global report of improvement.


Method
 We used data collected (n = 1039) from three randomized controlled trials for the management of depression. Improvement on a ‘global rating of change’ question was compared with changes in {BDI}-{II} scores using general linear modelling to explore baseline dependency, assessing whether {MCID} is best measured in absolute terms (i.e. difference) or as percent reduction in scores from baseline (i.e. ratio), and receiver operator characteristics ({ROC}) to estimate {MCID} according to the optimal threshold above which individuals report feeling ‘better’.


Results
Improvement in {BDI}-{II} scores associated with reporting feeling ‘better’ depended on initial depression severity, and statistical modelling indicated that {MCID} is best measured on a ratio scale as a percentage reduction of score. We estimated a {MCID} of a 17.5\% reduction in scores from baseline from {ROC} analyses. The corresponding estimate for individuals with longer duration depression who had not responded to antidepressants was higher at 32\%.


Conclusions
{MCID} on the {BDI}-{II} is dependent on baseline severity, is best measured on a ratio scale, and the {MCID} for treatment-resistant depression is larger than that for more typical depression. This has important implications for clinical trials and practice.},

	abstract = {Human ovulation is not advertised, as it is in several primate species, by conspicuous sexual swellings. However, there is increasing evidence that the attractiveness of women’s body odor, voice, and facial appearance peak during the fertile phase of their ovulatory cycle. Cycle effects on facial attractiveness may be underpinned by changes in facial skin color, but it is not clear if skin color varies cyclically in humans or if any changes are detectable. To test these questions we photographed women daily for at least one cycle. Changes in facial skin redness and luminance were then quantified by mapping the digital images to human long, medium, and shortwave visual receptors. We find cyclic variation in skin redness, but not luminance. Redness decreases rapidly after menstrual onset, increases in the days before ovulation, and remains high through the luteal phase. However, we also show that this variation is unlikely to be detectable by the human visual system. We conclude that changes in skin color are not responsible for the effects of the ovulatory cycle on women’s attractiveness.},
