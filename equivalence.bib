Equivalence tests are available for several research designs, however, paired-samples equivalence tests that are accessible and relevant to the research performed by psychologists have been understudied. This study evaluated parametric and nonparametric two one-sided paired-samples equivalence tests and a standardized paired-samples equivalence test developed by Wellek (2003). The two one-sided procedures had better Type I error control and greater power than Wellek's test, with the nonparametric procedure having increased power with non normal distributions.},

	abstract = {Bioequivalence between two treatments or two drugs is often assessed by comparing the two proportions (success rate or eradication rate) of binomial outcomes when the conventional pharmacokinetic parameters are inadequate for the assessment. Setting the equivalence limits can be based on one of the three measures: difference, ratio, or odds ratio between the two binomial probabilities. This paper reviews the existing asymptotic test statistics for comparing two independent binomial probabilities in terms of the three measures in the context of equivalence or noninferiority testing. The actual type I error and power of the asymptotic tests are evaluated by enumerating the exact probabilities in the rejection region. The results show that to establish an equivalence between two treatments with an equivalence limit of 20\% in difference, a sample size of at least 50 per treatment is needed. When the sample size is sufficient, the actual type I error rate is close to the nominal level (slightly above the nominal level in several cases) for a test in terms of difference for equivalence limits, and it tends to exceed the nominal level for tests in terms of ratio or odds ratio.},

	abstract = {Scientists should be able to provide support for the absence of a meaningful effect. Currently, researchers often incorrectly conclude an effect is absent based a nonsignificant result. A widely recommended approach within a frequentist framework is to test for equivalence. In equivalence tests, such as the two one-sided tests (TOST) procedure discussed in this article, an upper and lower equivalence bound is specified based on the smallest effect size of interest. The TOST procedure can be used to statistically reject the presence of effects large enough to be considered worthwhile. This practical primer with accompanying spreadsheet and R package enables psychologists to easily perform equivalence tests (and power analyses) by setting equivalence bounds based on standardized effect sizes and provides recommendations to prespecify equivalence bounds. Extending your statistical tool kit with equivalence tests is an easy way to improve your statistical and theoretical inferences.},
